# relational operators

# Logical operators
print(a&c) #It is called Element-wise Logical AND operator. It combines each element of the first vector with the corresponding element of the second vector and gives a output TRUE if both the elements are TRUE.
print(a|c)#It is called Element-wise Logical OR operator. It combines each element of the first vector with the corresponding element of the second vector and gives a output TRUE if one the elements is TRUE.
print(!d) #It is called Logical NOT operator. Takes each element of the vector and gives the opposite logical value.

# The logical operator && and || considers only the first element of the vectors and give a vector of single element as output.
print(a&&b) #Called Logical AND operator. Takes first element of both the vectors and gives the TRUE only if both are TRUE.
